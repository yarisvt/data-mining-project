### Abstract
In this project, we try to predict whether a person is more likely to suffer a stroke based on a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) with possible risk factors. To predict stroke, we create five decision trees and train a Keras model on the previously mentioned dataset. This dataset is oversampled due to a lack of stroke patients in the dataset. For the best performing decision tree, we get an accuracy of 0.86. For the model, we get an accuracy of 0.60.
